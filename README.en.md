## 🚀 About Me

I've been passionate about technology since I was a kid, and today I apply that passion to real projects.  
I have experience with electronics, automation, web development, and content creation.  
I build useful systems, practical interfaces, and solutions that make a difference — always seeking to connect people with technology in an accessible and creative way.

I'm a certified Industrial Automation Technician and currently studying Computer Science.  
I lead freelance projects involving development, automation, WhatsApp bots, and much more.
